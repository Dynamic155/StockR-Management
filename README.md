# StockR-Management

Certainly! Let's outline a basic idea and layout for a stock management system for a home furniture retail store using C#. The system will consist of several key components and functionalities.

### Overview of the Stock Management System

**Purpose:** 
To allow the home furniture retail store to manage all aspects of their stock, including entering new stock, allocating existing stock, and running reports based on these elements.

### Key Features

1. **Stock Management:**
   - **Add New Stock:** Enter details of new stock items.
   - **Update Stock:** Modify details of existing stock items.
   - **Delete Stock:** Remove stock items from the system.
   - **Allocate Stock:** Assign stock to different departments or stores.

2. **Reporting:**
   - **Stock Levels:** Generate reports on current stock levels.
   - **Stock Movement:** Track the movement of stock items (incoming and outgoing).
   - **Inventory Valuation:** Calculate the total value of inventory.

### Architecture and Components

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Desktop application using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
   - Web application using ASP.NET MVC or Blazor for broader access.

2. **Business Logic Layer:**
   - C# classes to handle the core functionality and business rules.
   - Services to manage operations like adding, updating, and allocating stock.

3. **Data Access Layer:**
   - Entity Framework Core for interacting with the database.
   - Repositories to abstract database operations.

4. **Database:**
   - SQL Server to store stock information, user data, and transaction logs.

### Detailed Layout

#### 1. User Interface (UI)
**Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Application:**

- **Main Window:** Navigation menu to access different features (Add Stock, Update Stock, Allocate Stock, Reports).
- **Add Stock Window:** Form to enter new stock details (name, category, quantity, price).
- **Update Stock Window:** Form to search and update existing stock items.
- **Allocate Stock Window:** Form to assign stock to departments or stores.
- **Reports Window:** Options to generate and view different types of reports.

#### 2. Business Logic Layer

**Services:**

- **StockService:**
  - Methods: `AddStock(StockItem item)`, `UpdateStock(StockItem item)`, `DeleteStock(int stockId)`, `AllocateStock(int stockId, string department)`.
- **ReportService:**
  - Methods: `GenerateStockLevelReport()`, `GenerateStockMovementReport()`, `GenerateInventoryValuationReport()`.

**Example Class: StockItem**

```csharp
public class StockItem
{
    public int StockId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

#### 3. Data Access Layer

**Repositories:**

- **StockRepository:**
  - Methods: `Add(StockItem item)`, `Update(StockItem item)`, `Delete(int stockId)`, `GetById(int stockId)`, `GetAll()`.

**Example Repository Interface:**

```csharp
public interface IStockRepository
{
    void Add(StockItem item);
    void Update(StockItem item);
    void Delete(int stockId);
    StockItem GetById(int stockId);
    IEnumerable<StockItem> GetAll();
}
```

**Entity Framework Configuration:**

- DbContext setup for managing database connections and sets.

```csharp
public class StockContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<StockItem> StockItems { get; set; }
    
    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("YourConnectionStringHere");
    }
}
```

### Development Phases

1. **Requirement Analysis:**
   - Gather detailed requirements from the retail store.
   - Define user roles and permissions.

2. **System Design:**
   - Create wireframes for the UI.
   - Design the database schema.
   - Define class diagrams and service interfaces.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Set up the project structure in Visual Studio.
   - Develop the UI components using WPF.
   - Implement the business logic and data access layers.
   - Integrate the layers and ensure smooth data flow.

4. **Testing:**
   - Unit testing for individual components.
   - Integration testing to ensure different parts of the system work together.
   - User acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Package the application for deployment.
   - Set up the database on a production server.
   - Install the application on user machines or deploy the web application.

6. **Maintenance:**
   - Provide ongoing support and updates.
   - Implement new features based on user feedback.

### Conclusion

By following this layout, you can develop a robust stock management system in C# that meets the needs of a home furniture retail store. The use of WPF for the desktop application, Entity Framework for data access, and a structured approach to business logic will ensure the application is maintainable and scalable.
